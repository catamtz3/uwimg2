        <h2>What is a Complexion Cupid?</h2>
        <p>
            A “Complexion Cupid” is a virtual ally designed to revolutionize the often
            daunting color-matching process. Many know that even professional makeup
            artists undergo extensive training to comprehend the intricacies of
            people's skin tones, undertones, winter/summer shades, and specific
            skin concerns. Unfortunately, this process can become even more overwhelming
            for individuals with colorblindness or those residing in communities with
            limited resources, such as access to physical stores.
            <br>
            <br>
            The Complexion Cupid seeks to demystify and overall simplify the
            color-matching process. Unlike methods that require a physical store
            visit, which can be unattainable for various communities, including
            those in rural areas, lacking local stores with color-matching services
            or facing barriers like inaccessible transportation, Complexion Cupid
            fully operates online!
            <br>
            <br>
            Our innovative program invites all individuals, including makeup novices,
            to upload an image and let the Complexion Cupid work its magic. The program
            will provide valuable insights into your skin tone through our skin analysis.
            With this information, the goal is to recommend potential foundation
            matches available online. The ultimate aim is to ensure a seamless and
            inclusive experience for all, regardless of familiarity with makeup.
