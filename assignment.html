        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <!--Present the promise/obstacle/solution for your project. What is the problem you are solving and why is it important to solve it?  -->
        <p>
            Color matching can seem like a nightmare for anyone. Even makeup artists
            must undergo training and practice on many clients to fully understand
            people's skin tones, undertones, winter/summer shades, skin concerns,
            and more. Unfortunately, this task can be even more daunting for people
            with color blindness. Some services, like color matching, require an
            individual to visit a store physically. However, physically visiting a
            store is unattainable for several communities, including those living
            in rural communities and lacking stores with color-matching services,
            those with inaccessible public transportation to the stores, or even
            because traveling can be incredibly tiring. Recognizing these individuals'
            unique challenges, we would like this program to simplify the color-matching
            process. By allowing individuals, including those new to makeup, to upload
            an image, the program will analyze and provide insight that will enable
            individuals to learn about the value of their skin tone. With this
            information, we aim to suggest potential foundation matches available
            online, ensuring a seamless and inclusive experience for all, regardless
            of experience level.

        <p> Current options include requiring an already matching foundation or being able to notice the correct undertone and shade. Through our research we learned of a open source project "TensorShade" on github but the associated web app has issues with contrast and lack of alternative text.</p>

        <p> We implemented this webpage, created the filters for foundation swatches and incorporated the TensorShade into one central location. We utilized VSCode and github to code and connect everything and our code was in Python, HTML.</p>
